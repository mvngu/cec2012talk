  \begin{itemize}
  \item The presence of communities in social networks is intuitive.
    %% Think of members of a social club such as a sports club, a
    %% professional association such as the ACM, the developers of a
    %% software project, or online communities such as Facebook
    %% groups.  The concept of communities can also be transferred to
    %% other types of networks.  In a financial or economic network, a
    %% community might be a group of organizations that trade more
    %% amongst themselves than with other organizations.  In a
    %% software network, a community might be a group of functions or
    %% modules that invoke each other more often than other functions
    %% or modules in a software package.
  \end{itemize}
