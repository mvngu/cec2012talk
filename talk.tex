  \begin{itemize}
  \item The presence of communities in social networks is intuitive.
    %% Think of members of a social club such as a sports club, a
    %% professional association such as the ACM, the developers of a
    %% software project, or online communities such as Facebook
    %% groups.  The concept of communities can also be transferred to
    %% other types of networks.  In a financial or economic network, a
    %% community might be a group of organizations that trade more
    %% amongst themselves than with other organizations.  In a
    %% software network, a community might be a group of functions or
    %% modules that invoke each other more often than other functions
    %% or modules in a software package.

\section{Motivation and aim}
%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Motivation and aim}
  %%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Uncover principles of community evolution.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Understand how a blog network evolve~\cite{LinEtAl2008}
    \item Discover calling patterns \& customer churns in a mobile
      phone network~\cite{GreeneEtAl2010,PallaEtAl2007}
    \item Map out the long-term collaboration among groups of
      researchers~\cite{PallaEtAl2007}
    \end{itemize}

  \item How does community size affect the evolution of communities?
    %% The above general question can be answered along two separate
    %% lines.  One is to focus on the scaling characteristic of
    %% community size and any implication that this has for the
    %% long-term statistical properties of communities.  Another is to
    %% focus on any effects that the minimum community size has on
    %% events in the history of communities.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the scaling characteristic of community size and the
      implication for community evolution?
      %% This relates to the long-term behaviour of the distribution
      %% of community size.

    \item How does the minimum size of communities affect the
      life-cycle of communities?
      %% This is about exploring the relationship between minimum
      %% community size and events in the history of communities.

    %% \item To what extent can the minimum community size be used to
    %%   filter out inactive communities?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Background}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Background}
  %%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Communities evolve according to a
    life-cycle~\cite{GreeneEtAl2010,PallaEtAl2007}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item birth \& death

    \item expand \& contract

    \item merge \& split
    \end{itemize}

  \item Communities are matched across time in order to infer the
    history of a ``dynamic community'' from birth to death.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Our contributions}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Our contributions}
  %%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The parameter $s_{\min}$, the minimum community size.

  \item An extended-life cycle model.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item direct: two communities match only each other

    \item missing: a community is dormant at a particular snapshot

    \item resume: a dormant community appears again

    \item stable: relatively little change in size between two
      consecutive snapshots

    \item stagnant: no change in size at all between two consecutive
      snapshots
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Experiments and methods}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Experiments and methods}
  %%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We constructed from the Genetic Programming bibliography
    yearly snapshots of a network of scientific co-authorship.

  \item From each snapshot, we extracted communities using the
    algorithm of Blondel~et~al.~\cite{BlondelEtAl2008a}.

  \item Communities were matched using the Jaccard coefficient
    $J(A,B) = |A \cap B| \big/ |A \cup B|$ to compute a measure of
    overlap.

  \item Two communities match each other if they had an overlap score
    of $J(A,B) > 0.3$.  In that case, we treated $A$ and $B$ as nodes
    and created a directed edge from $A$ to $B$.

  \item Extract the history of each dynamic community by doing
    depth-first searches from communities that occurred in the
    earliest snapshots, and work our way up to communities that
    occurred in the latest snapshots.
  \end{itemize}
